# Quora-Duplicate-Question-Detection

Developed a Natural Language Processing system to detect duplicate questions on Quora using logistic regression,
achieving 80% accuracy. Implemented comprehensive text pre-processing including stemming and stop word
removal, and engineered features using n-gram representations (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams). Utilized
scikit-learn and NLTK libraries in Python for model development and evaluation.
